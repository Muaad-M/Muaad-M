# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio

> *"I am not here to impress — I’m here to improve. I am a student of threats, a builder of resilience, and a quiet but persistent force in this battlefield. Cybersecurity is my craft, my mission, and my lifelong pursuit — and I will defend, learn, and lead with humility, every day until the job is done."*

## About Me

Hi, I’m Muaad M., a cybersecurity practitioner transitioning from IT support into active blue team operations. My journey so far has been fuelled by **self-study**, **simulated threats**, and an obsession with understanding the adversary. 

This portfolio reflects late nights, failed attempts, retries, and ultimately — growth.

I am based in London UK and currently seeking opportunities in cybersecurity, particularly in SOC operations and as a Cybersecurity Analyst.

## Career Objective

I am looking for roles that will allow me to deepen my skills in **SOC operations**, **incident detection**, and **threat response**. I am particularly interested in roles where I can work with teams that focus on real-world attacks and implement cutting-edge defensive strategies. 

> **"Cybersecurity is a craft — every day I aim to be sharper than yesterday."**

## Operational Ethos

Cybersecurity is a battleground. But not one won with bravado — it’s won with readiness, reflection, and a relentless commitment to growth.

I train daily, not because I know everything, but because I don’t. I read, simulate, break, and rebuild. I learn from the experts, and from my own mistakes. 

I approach cybersecurity with the discipline of a **soldier**, the curiosity of a **strategist**, and the humility of a **lifelong learner**.

## Professional Background

### 🛠️ IT & Network Support Technician

Before transitioning into cybersecurity, I worked in a frontline IT support role, where I applied secure configuration practices and led initiatives to harden systems against common attack vectors:

- Configured BIOS settings on student desktop machines to **disable USB ports**, mitigating the risk of malware infections via unauthorised flash drives.
- Hardened web browser settings across student workstations to prevent storage of personal data, enhancing privacy and reducing data leakage risks.
- Installed and pinned only approved applications on desktops to **restrict unauthorised software installations**, reducing exposure to malware and watering hole attacks.
- Orchestrated a **proactive IT maintenance schedule**, reducing hardware/software failures by 40% and closing critical security vulnerabilities.
- Trained and mentored a team of 9 IT support colleagues, embedding cybersecurity awareness, safe handling of user data, and correct escalation procedures.

This experience gave me a strong operational foundation and highlighted the importance of defence-in-depth from the endpoint up.

## Incident Response Experience

I am incident response-tested through the completion of two advanced, simulation-based scenarios designed to replicate real SOC environments:

### 🔐 Telstra, Australia – *Security Operations Analyst* *(3hr Simulation)*  
- Triaged a **high-severity malware incident** through SIEM and firewall log analysis, aiding containment.
- Helped identify and block over **1,500 Spring4Shell-related intrusion attempts** by updating detection logic reviewed by senior analysts.
- Contributed to **post-incident review** documentation: timelines, findings, and lessons learned.

### 🛡️ ANZ, Australia – *Security Analyst* *(3hr Simulation)*  
- Analysed **suspicious emails** via header inspection and sandboxing; extracted and reported IOCs to improve mail filtering.
- Diagnosed **internal network anomalies** using Wireshark and hex analysis; recovered artefacts and reported findings.
- Authored concise **incident notes** adopted in SOC tracking and used by senior analysts for briefings.
