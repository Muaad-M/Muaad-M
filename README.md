# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio

> *"I'm not here to impress — I'm here to improve. I'm a student of threats, a builder of resilience, and a quiet but persistent force in this field. Cybersecurity is my craft, my mission, and my lifelong pursuit — and I will defend, learn, and grow with humility, every day until the job is done."*

## About Me

Hi, I’m Muaad M. — someone who’s making the leap from IT & Network support into the world of cybersecurity.  

This portfolio is the result of **months of self-study**, **hands-on learning**, and a real passion for blue team operations. I've spent a lot of time trying things, breaking things, fixing them, and learning from it all.

I’m based in **London, UK** and currently looking for opportunities in **SOC operations** or as a **Cybersecurity Analyst**. I'm especially drawn to environments where I can keep growing, stay challenged, and contribute to a real-world defence mission.

## Career Objective

I'm looking to join a team where I can apply and deepen my skills in **incident detection**, **threat response**, and **SOC operations**.  

My goal is to learn from real-world threats, sharpen my defensive strategies, and contribute meaningfully — even as a junior.

> **"Cybersecurity is a craft — every day I try to be a bit sharper than the day before."**

---

## My Approach

I don’t come from a traditional cybersecurity background — which is why I work harder.  

I train daily, not because I know it all, but because I don’t. I break things on purpose just to understand how to fix them. I ask questions. I reflect. I keep going.

I approach cybersecurity with the discipline of a **soldier**, the curiosity of a **strategist**, and the mindset of a **student** — always learning, always listening.

## Professional Background

### 🛠️ IT & Network Support Technician

Before making the switch to cybersecurity, I worked in hands-on IT support. During that time, I began to think more defensively — and took initiative to apply secure configurations wherever possible:

- Disabled USB ports via BIOS to reduce malware risks from unauthorised devices  
- Hardened browser settings to enhance privacy and prevent data leakage  
- Locked down desktops to restrict unauthorised software installations  
- Created a regular maintenance routine that cut critical issues by 40%  
- Mentored a small team of support staff on security-first thinking  

This gave me a strong foundation — and showed me how vital endpoint security is.

## Incident Response Simulations

I've completed two **SOC-style simulations** designed to mirror real-life incidents. These scenarios tested my ability to triage, investigate, and document fast-moving threats.

### 🔐 Telstra, Australia – *Security Operations Analyst (3hr)*  
- Investigated a malware alert via SIEM and firewall logs  
- Helped block over **1,500 Spring4Shell attempts** by improving detection logic  
- Wrote up findings and lessons learned in a post-incident report  

### 🛡️ ANZ, Australia – *Security Analyst (3hr)*  
- Investigated suspicious emails using headers and sandboxing  
- Diagnosed internal anomalies via Wireshark and hex analysis  
- Wrote SOC notes that were used in team briefings
