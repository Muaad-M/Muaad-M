# 🛡️ Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio

> **"Victory in cyber defence comes from preparation, pattern recognition, and persistence. This is my battlefield — and I enter it with discipline, purpose, and humility."**

## ⚔️ Operational Ethos

Cybersecurity is a battleground. But not one won with bravado — it’s won with readiness, reflection, and a relentless commitment to growth.

I train daily, not because I know everything, but because I don’t. I read, simulate, break, and rebuild. I learn from the experts, and from my own mistakes. I document not just wins, but near-misses — because every log, every alert, every overlooked packet is a lesson.

I approach cybersecurity with the discipline of a **soldier**, the curiosity of a **strategist**, and the humility of a **lifelong learner**.

> "The mission is not perfection — it's progression. Every day I aim to be sharper than yesterday."

## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m Muaad M., a cybersecurity practitioner transitioning from IT support into active blue team operations. My journey so far has been fuelled by **self-study**, **simulated threats**, and an obsession with understanding the adversary. 

Everything you see here is the result of late nights, failed attempts, re-tries, and finally, growth. I don’t claim to be an expert — I’m a **dedicated apprentice of the craft**, learning by doing and improving every day.

## ⚔️ The Defender’s Creed

> *"I am not here to impress — I’m here to improve. I am a student of threats, a builder of resilience, and a quiet but persistent force in this battlefield. Cybersecurity is my craft, my mission, and my lifelong pursuit — and I will defend, learn, and lead with humility, every day until the job is done."*
