# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio

> *"I am not here to impress — I’m here to improve. I am a student of threats, a builder of resilience, and a quiet but persistent force in this battlefield. Cybersecurity is my craft, my mission, and my lifelong pursuit — and I will defend, learn, and lead with humility, every day until the job is done."*

## About Me

Hi, I’m Muaad M., a cybersecurity practitioner transitioning from IT support into active blue team operations. My journey so far has been fuelled by **self-study**, **simulated threats**, and an obsession with understanding the adversary. 

Everything you see here is the result of late nights, failed attempts, re-tries, and finally, growth. I don’t claim to be an expert — I’m a **dedicated apprentice of the craft**, learning by doing and improving every day.

I am currently seeking opportunities in cybersecurity, particularly in SOC operations and as a Cybersecurity Analyst.

## Career Objective

I am looking for roles that will allow me to deepen my skills in **SOC operations**, **incident detection**, and **threat response**. I am particularly interested in roles where I can work with teams that focus on real-world attacks and implement cutting-edge defensive strategies. 

> **"Cybersecurity is a craft — every day I aim to be sharper than yesterday."**

## Operational Ethos

Cybersecurity is a battleground. But not one won with bravado — it’s won with readiness, reflection, and a relentless commitment to growth.

I train daily, not because I know everything, but because I don’t. I read, simulate, break, and rebuild. I learn from the experts, and from my own mistakes. I document not just wins, but near-misses — because every log, every alert, every overlooked packet is a lesson.

I approach cybersecurity with the discipline of a **soldier**, the curiosity of a **strategist**, and the humility of a **lifelong learner**.

## Projects

> Every project below is a self-built simulation of real-world attacks, showing the **full workflow**: detection → response → documentation.

- [Azure Honeynet & Security Monitoring](https://github.com/Muaad-M/Cybersecurity-Projects/tree/main/0-Azure-Honeynet-%26-Security-Monitoring)  
  *Simulated and monitored a honeynet within Azure to practice detection and response capabilities.*
  
- [Onboarding a VM to MDE Isolation and Investigation](https://github.com/Muaad-M/Cybersecurity-Projects/tree/main/1-Onboarding-a-VM-to-MDE-Isolation-and-Investigation)  
  *Walkthrough of onboarding a VM to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, isolating it, and conducting an investigation.*
