# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio

> *"I am not here to impress — I’m here to improve. I am a student of threats, a builder of resilience, and a quiet but persistent force in this battlefield. Cybersecurity is my craft, my mission, and my lifelong pursuit — and I will defend, learn, and lead with humility, every day until the job is done."*

## About Me

Hi, I’m Muaad M., a cybersecurity practitioner transitioning from IT support into active blue team operations. My journey so far has been fuelled by **self-study**, **simulated threats**, and an obsession with understanding the adversary. 

Everything you see here is the result of late nights, failed attempts, re-tries, and finally, growth. I don’t claim to be an expert — I’m a **dedicated apprentice of the craft**, learning by doing and improving every day.

## Operational Ethos

Cybersecurity is a battleground. But not one won with bravado — it’s won with readiness, reflection, and a relentless commitment to growth.

I train daily, not because I know everything, but because I don’t. I read, simulate, break, and rebuild. I learn from the experts, and from my own mistakes. I document not just wins, but near-misses — because every log, every alert, every overlooked packet is a lesson.

I approach cybersecurity with the discipline of a **soldier**, the curiosity of a **strategist**, and the humility of a **lifelong learner**.

> "The mission is not perfection — it's progression. Every day I aim to be sharper than yesterday."

## Career Intent

I am currently seeking opportunities in cybersecurity — particularly in SOC operations and Cybersecurity Analyst.  
This GitHub is my public logbook: a transparent record of how I think, what I build, and how I respond to threats in a practical environment.

## Community Training: The Cyber Range

I’ve levelled up my Azure and Microsoft stack experience through **The Cyber Range**, a practical, live-fire cyber training community.

It provided access to:

- **Microsoft Sentinel** (SIEM)
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** (EDR)
- **Azure VMs** for sandboxing and lab simulations
- **Tenable** for vulnerability management
- Real-world production-style SOC scenarios and mentorship

## Lifelong Commitment

I’m not chasing titles — I’m building capability.

This portfolio isn’t polished — it’s real. Every commit is a step forward. I believe in:

- Daily upskilling  
- Reviewing and rebuilding  
- Asking for feedback  
- Staying teachable — even under pressure
